                known as the "National Youth Administration"
              </li>

                Inspired by Elvin
                Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
                plants.

                military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
                applied science.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology

                flies to Mexico to
                head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of
                disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American
                breed, creating a strain
                that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
                subcontinent in time to

              <li>
                <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                genetically modified
                crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
                inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
                before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.
